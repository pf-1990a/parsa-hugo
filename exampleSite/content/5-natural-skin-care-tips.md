Everyone wants an acne-free flawless skin. If you are looking some natural skin care tips, you have landed on the right page. The beauty secrets revealed in this article will help you fix your skin care issues so you can get a beautiful skin naturally. Read on to find out more.

**1. Remove makeup before bed**

Before you go to sleep, don't forget to remove your makeup. Actually, your skin needs to breath while you are asleep but the makeup won't let it. What happens is that the makeup clogs the pores making it harder for your skin to breathe. To remove the dirt and makeup, all you have to do is use some olive oil on a fresh cotton pad and then massage your skin with it gently. Moreover, it's a good idea to exfoliate your skin at least once a week to get rid of the dead skin cells.

**2. Use Sunscreen**

For protection against the UVB and UVA rays of the sun, make sure you apply sunscreen. Your skin can get wrinkles if exposed to the sun for a lifetime. Aside from this, the prolonged exposure may cause age spots and many other skin issues. Make sure the sunscreen won't block the pores on your skin. It's not a good idea to skip the sunscreen when it's cold or cloudy outside. Even if you are going to the beach, apply some sunscreen on your skin.

**3. Eat well**

Don't just put anything on your plate. What you need to do is make greens, fresh fruits, vitamins and protein part of your meals. As a matter of fact, if your diet is full of vitamin C, your skin will get better. It's a good idea to go for a low-sugar diet. This can help you control your insulin levels and your body will be able to sustain a healthy balance. You may want to stay away from spicy foods, citrus fruits, salt and fried food. What you can do is prefer blander foods like applesauce and oatmeal. Greens and fresh fruits are healthy for your skin.

**4. Exercise regularly**  
For better blood circulation, it's important that you exercise on a regular basis. Yoga, jogging and running are good choices as they boost the cleaning processes in your body. With this routine, you will notice that your face has started glowing.

**5. Sleep well**  
It's important to get at least 8 hours of sleep every night. Not getting enough sleep will make your skin get tired. It will become saggy and you will get bags around your eyes. It's a good idea to apply some honey on your face on a weekly basis to heal and soothe your skin. Before you go to sleep, don't forget to moisturize your face. So, if you are looking for some skin care tips, we suggest that you follow these natural tips. This will cost you nothing, your skin will start glowing, and you will look much younger for your age.
