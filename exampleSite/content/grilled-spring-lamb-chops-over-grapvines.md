Not many things please me more than the thought of lamb chops grilled over dry grapevine branches. Get your lamp chops about 1cm thick this allows more surface area for the amount of meat you are grilling, get some charcoal going and let it turn to ash, and pour yourself a glass of crispy dry ice cold white wine. Then when you're ready throw toss the lamb in salt and pepper and get them on the grill over the grape vines, don't mind a bit of charring its all flavour, they should take about 1-2 minutes per side then serve.

I like to serve with lemon, a [greek salad]() and some ice cold dry white wine.

This works easily good with pork, however in this case I would marinade the pork for a few hours in the following ingredients

* Lemon juice
* Garlic pressed fine
* Olive oil
* Thyme
* Oregano
* Chilli flakes
* Salt and Pepper

If using pieces of pork shoulder cut into cubes, marinade and skewer, or if shops leave them whole. When grilling watch the fat drips from the pork and ensure the fire doesn't catch.

Enjoy!
