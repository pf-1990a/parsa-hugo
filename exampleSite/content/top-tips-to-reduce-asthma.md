If you suffer from eczema, then you've most likely tried a variety of products to help with the itching and dryness to which only left your skin feeling more irritated and drier. Try these top tips to help calm your skin and reduce the effects of eczema

* As you may have experienced, when you have a flare-up with your eczema, the itching associated with it is almost intolerable. As much as you'd want to scratch the affected area, you know that if you do it will only make matters worse. Applying a cold compress will reduce the inflammation and ease your desire to scratch.
* People that suffer from eczema are susceptible to skin infections. The skin becomes irritated, sometimes surface cracks and gaps are formed allowing germs and bacteria to invade the skin and cause an infection. To decrease this risk, try using a mild, non-drying cleanser on your skin and gently apply the cleanser with your fingertips and rinse it off with warm water.
* Get your skin damp before applying your moisturiser. This helps the moisturiser to seal into your skin and soften it. Following your shower or bath, just pat your skin with a towel. This will remove a lot of the wetness but still leave the skin damp and ready for moisturising. An effective method to help reduce flare-ups is to apply a moisturising lotion that works best with your skin type and condition. You may have to reapply the moisturiser a few times each day for maximum relief.
* While there are many over the counter products that claim to relieve the symptoms from eczema, there are several natural remedies to consider, some of which you may already have at home.
* Colloidal oatmeal is available in a powder form and when added to your bath water it helps to calm your skin and soften any inflamed areas after 10 or 15 minutes.
* Coconut oil is a natural moisturiser and it contains natural antibacterial abilities to help reduce bacteria, which helps prevent infection.
* Sunflower oil can protect the skin's outer layer, allowing the moisture to be absorbed and keeping the bacteria out. Sunflower oil can be applied directly on to the skin or after showering while the skin is wet.
* Aloe Vera has many great properties such as; antioxidant, antimicrobial, immune-boosting and wound-healing which helps with the symptoms of eczema. Aloe Vera can be stored in the refrigerator, when applied it will have a nice cooling sensation which will feel great on your skin.
* If the air in your room is too dry, it may cause your eczema to act up. Therefore, a humidifier is often an important addition to an eczema sufferer's home. Consider which rooms you spend the most time in and place the humidifier there. You should notice a difference in your skin.
* It's important to keep your skin clean using a gentle cleaning method and finding a cleanser that free of chemicals or heavy fragrances. Don't forget to use sunscreen to help protect your skin from drying or becoming sun burned. Apply your moisturiser on damp skin, just out of the shower or bath is ideal. When showering, avoid using hot water as that only irritates your skin.
* Should you find that none of these tips help, please consult a doctor or dermatologist as they may be able to prescribe a medicated topical cream to relieve the symptoms of eczema. You may also consider looking into Botox as an eczema treatment too.
