Seychelles a land of pristine beauty and a luxury destination which lies in the western part of the Indian Ocean. An archipelago of 115 islands, the island nation is known for its exquisite natural beauty, spectacular beaches, and luxury resorts. It is home to the world's oldest ocean islands and largest raised coral atoll.

The island is blessed with a warm climate throughout the year making it a hotbed for water activities such as diving and snorkelling in its clear turquoise waters. It is also a hub for ecotourism and endemic wildlife spotting offering an incredible variety of flora and fauna with some of the most exotic trees, birds and marine life.

The entire population is concentrated in the inner part region which consists of three islands of Mahe, Praslin and La Digue. Together these islands form the economic, cultural and tourism hub of the country. Do not miss out on the chance of exploring the Seychellois Creole cuisine and the country's capital Victoria, a city that can be explored entirely on foot in less than a day.

Due to its remote location, the island nation is unlike any other island getaway. This tropical paradise provides an aura of seclusion marked by soft white powdery sands and spectacular turquoise waters.
