Santorini... What can one say?

I landed in Santorini, Greece at 6:30am and was hot and bothered, the line in the airport took about two hours to process, I was tired, hungry and thirsty. Not a fantastic start I thought.

I had flown in from 'sunny' Manchester for a week long job taking photos of Villas on the island. I had a bunch of cameras and drones with me and my basic plan was to get all the shots in the first 4 days then spend a few days relaxing, all whilst avoiding Covid-19.

By about 9am I had picked up my car (Quadbike) at the airport and eased out on the dusty roads of Santorini. My client had emailed me a hand drawn map (no addresses on Santorini) and told me how to access each property so with printed map in hand and with the help of google maps i soon found myself barreling along backroads towards the beach town of Kamari for the first shots.

I located the property a few blocks back from the beach over towards the mountain side and spent the next few hours climbing over fences and in bushes trying to get the best long distance shots of the villa, and after some drone flybys and arial stills I was done. 1 down 12 to go I thought to myself.

Santorini is hot, very hot, so I raced over to the next location which was back around the edge of the mountain, I was hoping for some shade and reprieve from the heat but only found myself shooting up a windy road, in effect getting closer to the sun, and hotter. I needed a hat.

This place was amazing, it had the longest narrow pool I had ever seen and the place was whiter than anything else, every surface was painted white, the chairs, the cushions, the wall all were white, the only thing not white was the pool water, which I so wanted to dive into! These shots turned out really good and within a couple of hours I was firing up the quadbike and leaving a trail of dust in my wake as I barrelled down the hill. My mission  was to find some food and a beer, which I did at 'Mike Grill House' in the lovely litte village of Mesaria, the Egyptian guys at Mikes were great and the food (and beer) was just what was needed.

While I was sitting in the outside eating area at Mikes I got a call from my local contact who had a little side job for me doing some shots of some cards for a local magazine, so with new directions in hand I fired up the quad and headed over to the location.

It was quite the place also! About 3 or so levels winding up the hillside, with amazing stonework and in the circular portico area sat blazing in the sun was 1 black and 1 white Porchse 911 turbos. they looked amazing with the house and blue sky as backdrops and we spent the next few hours getting the exterior shots then moved inside the garage to do some interior shots. We organised to meet up later in the evening and with that I was on my way again back to the town of Kamari to do another villas that was now empty.

This place was pretty straight forward and the house was cool and it did have an amazing wine cellar which was nice to be in for a while to escape the heat!

It was about 7pm when I had finished chatting and packing up and I was meeting my contact George at 8 so barrelled over to my hotel in Thira, got changed and met George for some drinks wile admiring to the famous Santorini Sunset.

I kept thinking to myself and I at work or on holiday as this place was so amazing, but I was soon to find out things are always not what they seem, more on that in part 2!

Stay tuned
