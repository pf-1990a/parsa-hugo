Who am I kidding!?!... Greek Salads aren't just for summer, but there is nothing like sitting outside with the water in the distance, the sun shining and perhaps the occasional cooling breeze, and before your lordship a table with good food and friends.

In such situations one of the things on that table **should** be a greek salad, it's so simple to throw together as follows:

* Tomato chunks
* Cucumber chunks
* Green peppers strips
* Red onion strips
* Caper leaves (these make it really special)
* Feta cheese

Simply mix all the veg together in a large bowl, then top with the cheese, pour over some nice Greek olive oil, some lemon wedges, salt and pepper and some dried thyme.

Done. Enjoy.
