After my initial day in Santorini I felt recharged, I had a long schedule today that would take me from one end of the island to the other and back. Starting in Oia, in the morning then back around to a place in Imerovigli, then Thira and finally back to Oia for sunset shots at the edge of the Caldera, the edge of the old Volcano. 

Luckily for me I had a guide today, George, was able to drive me around and he was a very interesting guy. As be sped along the flat roads on the back side of the island I learned that Santorini was actually once an almost complete circle of islands however a massive explosion around 1600 BC the volcano erupted and half the island was blown apart. This has been recorded as the largest explosion in the history of mankind and many times larger than Krakatoa. George told me there were hardly any human bones or human objects found in the archaeological site on the island and that this meant the volcano was 'simmering' as he called it for some time and most of the inhabitants left before the big explosion. I set a note in book to remind myself to try and find any records of this explosion in any other cultures around this time.
