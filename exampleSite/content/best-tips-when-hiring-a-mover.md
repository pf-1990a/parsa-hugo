If you don't want to move your stuff to your new house yourself, you can look for a good mover to do the job for you. Although there are tons of listings of movers on the Internet, it's still a challenge to choose the right service. Therefore, if you want to hire the right company, we suggest that you avoid doing some common mistakes. Let's discuss some of the most common ones. Read on to know more.

**Not Getting estimates From multiple Movers**

Regardless of the location of your new house or apartment, make sure you create a short list of at least three service providers. In fact, it's much better to get quotes from 5 companies. Afterwards, you should compare the costs and consider the suggestions given by your friends and family.

Apart from this, you should do your research and do a background check on all the services providers. This will make sure you hire the right provider. Also, this will help you save hundreds of bucks.

**Not Inviting them to visit your home**

For an accurate estimate, we suggest that you allow the service provider to visit your apartment or house. They will take a look at your stuff to give you a more accurate quote. So, you should show them everything that you want them to move to your new house. It's much better to have an inventory list as well.

**Hiring a Cheap Mover**

It's not a good idea to make your selection based on the price alone. So, what you should do is thoroughly research the service provider. Keep in mind that you will get what you pay for.

If you don't have expensive stuff to move or you are going to move your stuff to a nearby location, you can go with a cheap mover as well. However, if your new house is far away from your existing house, it's much better to pay a bit more and go with a better company.

**Not Asking the Important Questions**

It's not easy to hire a mover. Since there are a lot of details to keep in mind, hiring the right one may be a hard nut to crack, especially for beginners. A reliable mover will give you the information you need and answer all your questions. So, it's better to create a list of questions that you should ask before hiring a mover.

Typically, rogue movers don't give straight answers to the questions they are asked. They will give you vague answers about insurance, fees and other details. Therefore, always ask the right questions before you make your final choice.

**Not Discussing the Extra Fees**

Don't forget to ask them about any extra costs that you may have to pay for, such as moving your stuff upstairs and packing fees. If you want to avoid surprises at the end, we suggest that you discuss all the charges with the provider.

In short, these are some common mistakes you should avoid while hiring a professional **moving company**.
