Don’t simply accept what’s happening in your life today. Not the problems, not your job, not your current income, not your present love life.

  
It doesn’t matter where you are right, now. It doesn’t matter that things aren’t turning out as you planned. It doesn’t matter what the economy is like, what your partner or boss or friends say. Doesn’t matter that you’re lacking in support or love, money or education. Whatever your history, every minute, every day from now on depends entirely on what you do going forward. It’s time to make the most of yourself.

**No limits**  
How about focussing on possibilities and skipping the thoughts of limitation. It’s time for each of us to rethink how we’re thinking. I’m not suggesting we run away with the idea that everything is possible to us right now, although as unlimited spiritual beings, it sort of is. For now it’s enough to know that what does lie within your reach is staggering.  
In any event it doesn’t matter much, because any actual limits we might have aren’t our current problem, they live far beyond our present thought boundaries. No, what’s currently boxing us in are the false and limiting beliefs we’re holding right now.

  
**Cherish a moment**  
Nurture yourself for a moment each day, because you deserve it. Be determined to enjoy some moments every day, whatever it takes. No moment will ever be improved by your negative thinking, so ditch it, just for this one moment and focus on the kind of life you want. Immerse yourself in an atmosphere of joy, peace and happiness. We are all originators of life, choose to originate all that is positive in your world and open the door to the phenomenal potential within.  
  
__**Seek awareness**__  
You are capable of anything but your current awareness gets in your way. We’re all experiencing what we’re aware of, which isn’t necessarily what we want.  
A person in a miserable relationship isn’t there because that’s what they want, they’re there because they don’t yet know how to do relationships differently.  
Someone with financial difficulties isn’t living like that because they want to, it’s because they’re not yet aware of how to experience greater financial success. Begin to be aware of how powerful you are and you’ll acquire more power, begin to be aware of joy, of love, of abundance and you’ll invite them into your world. It’s the truth of who you are.

  
**Change your response**  
The moment you change your responses is the moment your life starts to improve. If what you were doing right now would make a difference then that difference would already be here. If you’re a bit scared to do something different it’s okay. Even the strongest ones amongst us might have to take a few deep breaths before taking a new step forward.  
If we want something different there’s only one thing to be done, we must do something differently, even if our knees are shaking and our spirit trembling.

**Watch your diet**  
Be careful of the thoughts you entertain. Let go of those that feel bad and if not all of them, give up some of them and watch how doing that changes your life. People will generously share their fears with you, but you don’t have to accept their mental diet, it’s the fuel of negativity. Don’t give permission to anyone to upset you, and you won’t get upset, no one can do this without your help. Begin the practice of being peaceful with everything and you’ll be connecting with peace. Where others see the darkness of difficulty, look for the light of opportunity and positivity and your positive feelings will lead you into positive action.

  
**Silly stupid lies**  
Life is full of so many silly, stupid things that steal our joy and purpose. The stupid lies you believe, that you’re not as valuable or as incredibly important in the scheme of life as you truly are. The stupid things we do because we see life as a battle, one that it seems we’re destined to lose. Far too often we’re misled by the glittering lights of fame, huge wealth or power as a means of keeping us safe from stupid things. And far too often we have come to believe so overwhelmingly in our thoughts, in the lies that keep us imprisoned, that we’ve become addicted to them. However silly they might be. 

We can’t change anything, if we can’t change our thinking. If you’re ready to start to live the life you’ve imagined and want to move forward, you must change how you view life; you must set your mind free from all the silly stupid lies.

Rise to the challenge and continue to move away from fear and contraction towards love…a state that doesn’t compare or measure, but expands.  
The most magical thing you can do for our world is to make the most of yourself. Go and live the life you’ve imagined.
