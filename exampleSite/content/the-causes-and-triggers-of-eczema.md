Eczema is a skin disease, which is mostly mistaken with other skin allergies like rashes and inflammations. The main cause of eczema is reduced moisture content in the skin which makes the skin damp and an easy target for bacteria to grow over there. Many allopathic medicines also cause eczema as one of their side effects.

  
Mostly it is stress and perfumed toiletries that give birth to skin irritation which later on turns into a cause of eczema. Allergies from pollutants and some specific external agents can also lead to eczema in the long run. People who travel a lot on business or are emigrating from one country to another country also face eczema problems due to the change in the climatic conditions.

  
Some people are prone to allergies more often than the others. Thus special attention is to be given to such cases where there are extremes in climate and pollution. Individuals suffering from eczema can get their problem treated though chemical medications or they can choose to use natural and herbal remedies as well. The choice is purely individual but results may vary from person to person.
